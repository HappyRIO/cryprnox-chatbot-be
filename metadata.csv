         FAQs        
What is the Cryptnox Hardware Wallet? The Cryptnox hardware wallet is a high-security solution based on smartcard technology. It supports BIP32 and BIP39 standards, making it compatible with most blockchain networks.    Do I need a Cryptnox Card to access the App? You can perfectly access the Cryptnox wallet mobile application without a card as long as a card was linked to the application previously. Without a card, you can check current balances, but a card is required to perform transactions.    Can I use DeFi and other Web3 applications using my Cryptnox Card? Absolutely. The mobile application is compatible with the WalletConnect standard which allows you to connect to most online web3 dapp. Just choose WalletConnect as a wallet option, scan the QR code with your phone app, follow the instructions on the screen, and your wallet is connected. You can then perform Defi transactions and event mint or transfer NFT.    Can I reset the card if I have lost the pin/puk credentials ? Storing your Pin and Puk together with either your backup card if you performed a Dual Card Setup, or a copy of your BIP39 (12 or 24 words) seed if it was externally injected, is a major security requirement. For protection, the Puk is required for reset.    Can I perform a Dual Card Setup with any pair of Cryptnox Wallet card ? You can only perform a Dual Card Setup with a pair or cards that was provided in the same pack. They should have a difference of one unit in the printed serial number.    Can I use an existing BIP39 seed with a Cryptnox Hardware Wallet ? Absolutely. If your seed originates from a BIP32/BIP39  wallet, you can inject it in a Cryptnox Harware Wallet card. For this, when starting the application, please choose “Other Options”, and “mnemonic”, and simply follow the instructions. You will be prompted to type in you 12 or 24 words seed.     What are the functions of Pin and Puk? The Pin and the Puk work in a similar way for accessing a phone sim card. The Pin is generally required for executing a transaction on other Cryptnox Card compatible applications. The Puk has administrative privileges, and is required for pairing your card with the biometrics of your phone, or for a reset.    Does Cryptnox have access to my wallet? Absolutely not. The wallet is  always created by the owner after receiving it, and a Cryptnox card is always required to perform transactions. It has no way to have access to your wallet.    What blockchain networks can I access using my Cryptnox card? The Cryptnox Hardware Wallet cards are compatible with bitcoin and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based blockchains. Should an EVM based network or coin not be originally listed in the Cryptnox Wallet application, it can be manually added.    How soon will I receive my card after ordering it? Delivery time can vary depending of location and sale channels. In general, it can take between one to seven days.    How is the dual card initialisation performed ? When starting the application, simply tap on “Dual Card Setup”, and follow the instructions. Both your cards will be ready to use in seconds! If necessary, you can also check our quick startup guide.    Was the card's firmware audited by an external cyber security firm? The Cybersecurity firm Cure53 was appointed to perform a security analysis of the card firmware.For more info on Cure53, go to https://cure53.de.                Linkedin

         FAQs        
What is the Cryptnox Hardware Wallet? The Cryptnox hardware wallet is a high-security solution based on smartcard technology. It supports BIP32 and BIP39 standards, making it compatible with most blockchain networks.    Do I need a Cryptnox Card to access the App? You can perfectly access the Cryptnox wallet mobile application without a card as long as a card was linked to the application previously. Without a card, you can check current balances, but a card is required to perform transactions.    Can I use DeFi and other Web3 applications using my Cryptnox Card? Absolutely. The mobile application is compatible with the WalletConnect standard which allows you to connect to most online web3 dapp. Just choose WalletConnect as a wallet option, scan the QR code with your phone app, follow the instructions on the screen, and your wallet is connected. You can then perform Defi transactions and event mint or transfer NFT.    Can I reset the card if I have lost the pin/puk credentials ? Storing your Pin and Puk together with either your backup card if you performed a Dual Card Setup, or a copy of your BIP39 (12 or 24 words) seed if it was externally injected, is a major security requirement. For protection, the Puk is required for reset.    Can I perform a Dual Card Setup with any pair of Cryptnox Wallet card ? You can only perform a Dual Card Setup with a pair or cards that was provided in the same pack. They should have a difference of one unit in the printed serial number.    Can I use an existing BIP39 seed with a Cryptnox Hardware Wallet ? Absolutely. If your seed originates from a BIP32/BIP39  wallet, you can inject it in a Cryptnox Harware Wallet card. For this, when starting the application, please choose “Other Options”, and “mnemonic”, and simply follow the instructions. You will be prompted to type in you 12 or 24 words seed.     What are the functions of Pin and Puk? The Pin and the Puk work in a similar way for accessing a phone sim card. The Pin is generally required for executing a transaction on other Cryptnox Card compatible applications. The Puk has administrative privileges, and is required for pairing your card with the biometrics of your phone, or for a reset.    Does Cryptnox have access to my wallet? Absolutely not. The wallet is  always created by the owner after receiving it, and a Cryptnox card is always required to perform transactions. It has no way to have access to your wallet.    What blockchain networks can I access using my Cryptnox card? The Cryptnox Hardware Wallet cards are compatible with bitcoin and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based blockchains. Should an EVM based network or coin not be originally listed in the Cryptnox Wallet application, it can be manually added.    How soon will I receive my card after ordering it? Delivery time can vary depending of location and sale channels. In general, it can take between one to seven days.    How is the dual card initialisation performed ? When starting the application, simply tap on “Dual Card Setup”, and follow the instructions. Both your cards will be ready to use in seconds! If necessary, you can also check our quick startup guide.    Was the card's firmware audited by an external cyber security firm? The Cybersecurity firm Cure53 was appointed to perform a security analysis of the card firmware.For more info on Cure53, go to https://cure53.de.                Linkedin

Smart Card PKI     Application of Public Key Infrastructure to
Smart Card for Blockchain Applications (Smart Card PKI)     Sebastien Armleder",https://cryptnox.com/smart-card-pki/
"[email protected]   www.cryptnox.com   Abstract. A smart card to be used for digital signatures is described. The smart card is factory set up with a unique identification number and digital certificate. The smart card is then associated with a user by a certification authority after successful verification of the identity of the user. Details that help in identifying the user are also transferred to the smart card by the certification authority. The smart card can then be used by the user to digitally sign documents. The smart card allows performing digital signatures with personal identification with an adjustable level of anonymity, traceability, and user-friendly private key management. It can also allow a robust, secure, and simple interaction with a blockchain.1. IntroductionDigital transactions have been on the rise over the last decade. They comprise not only traditional transactions for purchases made over e-commerce websites, but also those made with cryptocurrencies. In the context of the latter, it is noteworthy that each transaction is recorded in a blockchain and contains details of the transaction, including details that can help identify the participants of the transaction. This may be accomplished by each of the participants digitally signing the transaction using their own, unique signature. This signature can be generated using, for example, private keys held by the participants and can be verified using public keys corresponding to the private keys held by the participants. Storing private keys securely, however, can be a problem. It may be preferable not to store them in an easy-to-read or copy format. Similarly, it should be possible to easily retrieve a copy of the key or regenerate it in case it gets lost. A device that allows key management is described here. It allows user-friendly key management and provides a secure and forgery-proof method to perform digital signatures using the device. Further, it allows easy regeneration of a new private key after successful authentication of the user by a certification authority in case of theft or loss.2. SolutionThe solution we propose relates to a smart card that its setup and initialized in a particular manner to allow personal identification of the user of the smart card with adjustable level of anonymity, traceability and user-friendly key management. The solution therefore allows robust, secure, and simple interaction with a blockchain.2.1 Setup The proposed technology includes a factory setup for a smart card. The setup protocol is depicted in Fig. 1 and consists of a random number generator RNG generating a random serial number SN inside the secure element SE of the smart card. A first pair of asymmetric cryptographic keys, consisting of a private key Kpriv and a public key Kpub, is also generated inside the secure element SE.Next, the serial number SN and the public key Kpub are used to certify the authenticity of the smart card, by means of a factory certification. The generated serial number and SN public key Kpub along with a digital signing request SR are sent to a certification server. The certification server then generates and digitally signs a digital certificate CCERT that certifies the authenticity of the smart card. The digital certificate can be an X509 digital certificate signed by the root certificate of the certification server. It contains (in an encrypted form) the serial number SN and the public key Kpub from the smart card and potentially other identifying information about the smart card. This digital certificate CCERT is then sent to the smart card.      With the aid of the digital certificate CCERT and the unique random number SN generated inside the secure element SE, the smart card becomes robust against forgery. These steps complete a factory setup of the smart card.2.2 InitializationAfter the factory setup, the smart card is ready to be associated with a user. In order to enhance security, the smart card is initialized for a particular user USR using an initialization protocol. The initial steps of this initialization protocol are depicted in Fig. 2. The first step of this initialization protocol consists in the identity of the user USR being verified by a certification authority CAUTH. The user USR provides personal data UDAT such as a social security number, or another identification number, to the certification authority CAUTH for verification.Upon successful verification of the identity of user USR, the certification authority CAUTH generates a pair of keys – a public key CKpub (also referred to as certificate public key) and a private key CKpriv (also referred to as certificate private key). Any suitable asymmetric cryptographic key generation algorithm can be used to generate this pair of keys. Next, the digital certificate CCERT is obtained from the smart card. The certification authority CAUTH uses the digital certificate CCERT together with the public key CKpub and the user data UDAT to generate a digital signing request CREQ.      The digital signing request CREQ is used to generate a digital certificate UCERT establishing ownership of the smart card by the user USR as follows. After generation of the digital signing request CREQ, the certification authority CAUTH verifies the authenticity of the digital certificate CCERT obtained from the smart card. If the verification is successful, the certification authority CAUTH generates the digital certificate UCERT with the help of the public key CKpub. The digital certificate UCERT may include the user identification data UDAT, the public key CKpub, and the digital certificate CCERT. Each of these can also be encrypted appropriately for storage on the digital certificate UCERT.The final step of the initialization protocol consists in sending the digital certificate UCERT and the wrapped private key CKpriv to the smart card. CKpriv needs is wrapped (i.e., encrypted) before it is transferred to the smart card for greater security. The encryption is carried out using the public key Kpub generated by the smart card. Kpub is contained in the digital certificate CCERT and so, also in the signing request CREQ. Thus, a wrapped private key WKpriv is also generated. Finally, the wrapped private key WKpriv and the digital certificate UCERT are sent to the smart card, wherein the wrapped private key WKpriv is sent to the secure element SE of the smart card.The further processing inside the secure element SE is depicted in Fig. 3. Using the private key Kpriv corresponding to the public key Kpub already present in the secure element SE of the smart card, the wrapped private key WKpriv is unwrapped to reveal the private key CKpriv. Then, based on the private key CKpriv received from the certification authority CAUTH, a random seed SEED is generated inside the secure element SE of the smart card. The seed SEED can be generated using an SHA256 or AES encryption algorithm. This seed may be used to digitally sign transactions using the smart card.      Thus, the smart card is set up initially with its own security features (digital certificate CCERT and unique serial number SN) and only after it is successfully set up, can it be associated with a user USR. The digital certificate UCERT and the private key CKpriv further serve to ensure the authenticity of the smart card and the user. At this stage, the secure element SE of the smart card contains the private key Kpriv generated inside it, the private key CKpriv provided by the certification authority CAUTH, and the random seed SEED generated inside the smart card using the private key CKpriv provided by the certification authority CAUTH, and the smart card is ready for digital signing.2.3 Digital signingFig. 4 depicts the process of digital signature using the smart card. A signing request SREQ is sent to the smart card. The signing request SREQ is transferred to the secure element SE of the smart card where a signature SSIGN is generated based on the request SREQ and the random seed SEED generated inside the smart card. Additionally, a certificate signature CSIGN based on the certificate private key CKpriv and the signature SSIGN, and a signature",https://cryptnox.com/smart-card-pki/
"the secure element SE of the smart card contains the private key Kpriv generated inside it, the private key CKpriv provided by the certification authority CAUTH, and the random seed SEED generated inside the smart card using the private key CKpriv provided by the certification authority CAUTH, and the smart card is ready for digital signing.2.3 Digital signingFig. 4 depicts the process of digital signature using the smart card. A signing request SREQ is sent to the smart card. The signing request SREQ is transferred to the secure element SE of the smart card where a signature SSIGN is generated based on the request SREQ and the random seed SEED generated inside the smart card. Additionally, a certificate signature CSIGN based on the certificate private key CKpriv and the signature SSIGN, and a signature KSIGN based on the private key Kpriv and the signature SSIGN are generated. All three signatures, SSIGN, CSIGN, and KSIGN are then output from the smart card and serve as the digital signature from the smart card.      Because of the dependence of SSIGN on the random seed SEED, that in turn depends on a successful verification of the user USR by the certification authority CAUTH, and the dependence of the two other signatures CSIGN and KSIGN on successful authentication by the certification authority CAUTH and successful factory set up respectively, the smart card provides a robust, secure, and traceable method to enable digital signatures.3 ConclusionThe smart card presented here thus combines within a secure element of a smart card various secrets with strictly limited computation possibilities. It is centered around fundamental concepts of public key infrastructure such as X509 digital certificates and certificate authorities. Moreover, the concepts presented here can be easily extended to secure elements belonging to other devices such as NFC smart cards. The technology described here can be applied to diverse areas such as whitelisting applications, identification, seed recovery, signing of blockchain transactions, and lost or stolen card identification. Thus, it provides an easy, secure, user-friendly solution for identification that is robust to forgery or hacking.",https://cryptnox.com/smart-card-pki/

You will then be able to use a Cryptnox Fido2 card to log into your Windows Microsoft account.    General Usage (Website Authentication)   The Cryptnox FIDO2 SmartCard supports two-factor authentication (2FA) and passwordless authentication:   With passwordless authentication, entering a password is replaced by logging in with the Cryptnox FIDO2 SmartCard.With two-factor authentication (2FA), the Cryptnox Fido2 SmartCard is resuired in addition to the password.   These possibilities depend of the website FIDO2 implementation. The request to authenticate with your Cryptnox Fido2 card is displayed as a pop-up notification with the “tap your security key on the reader” mention. See examples below.       With an NFC reader: simply remove and replace the Cryptnox FIDO2 SmartCard from the reader.With Contact reader: while keeping the reader connected to the desktop/laptop via USB, remove and replace the Cryptnox FIDO2 SmartCard from the reader.   Testing   For testing, you can try registering and logging into the following “test” websites: https://fido2-testing-tool.cryptnox.com  Or https://webauthn.ioMake sure your Cryptnox FIDO2 SmartCard is connected to the desktop with an NFC or contact reader.If the box “Authenticator Type” appears, choose “Cross Platform” (If you choose “Platform” it will use your computer operating system to store the credentials).Click Register and follow instructions. If asked to “tap your security key on the reader” with a contact reader, extract and reinsert the card in the reader while keeping the reader connected to the desktop.Other demo sites: Webauthn.me   Testing Sites accepting FIDO2 and U2F   Best is to check your usual websites if they already support Fido2 Security Protocol. More and more sites support such protocol every day. If they do, they generally have specific instructions. A non exhaustive list of sites accepting Fido2 and/or U2F can be found on Hideez site. In Security Protocol, choose either U2F or Fido2/Webauthn.   An example: Google Account 2FA login   Go to Manage Your Google Account and enable two steps verification following the instructions on: Enable 2-step verification for added account security Then go to Manage Your Google Account -> Security -> 2-Step verification -> Security Keys Then click on “Add security key” and follow the instructions on the screen   Managing your Crypntox Fido2 Card (Reset or Pin management)   You can manage the pin or reset your Cryptnox Fido2 Card with a Windows Desktop/laptop connected to a card reader. Go to Settings -> Accounts -> Sign In Options -> Security Key -> Manage      You can manage the pin or reset your Cryptnox Fido2 Card with a Windows Desktop/laptop connected to a card reader. Go to Settings -> Accounts -> Sign In Options -> Security Key -> Manage   AAGUID   In some rare cases, you are required to provide the AAGUID of the Cryptnox FIDO2 SmartCard: 9c835346–796b-4c27–8898-d6032f515cc5

         FAQs        
What is the Cryptnox Hardware Wallet? The Cryptnox hardware wallet is a high-security solution based on smartcard technology. It supports BIP32 and BIP39 standards, making it compatible with most blockchain networks.    Do I need a Cryptnox Card to access the App? You can perfectly access the Cryptnox wallet mobile application without a card as long as a card was linked to the application previously. Without a card, you can check current balances, but a card is required to perform transactions.    Can I use DeFi and other Web3 applications using my Cryptnox Card? Absolutely. The mobile application is compatible with the WalletConnect standard which allows you to connect to most online web3 dapp. Just choose WalletConnect as a wallet option, scan the QR code with your phone app, follow the instructions on the screen, and your wallet is connected. You can then perform Defi transactions and event mint or transfer NFT.    Can I reset the card if I have lost the pin/puk credentials ? Storing your Pin and Puk together with either your backup card if you performed a Dual Card Setup, or a copy of your BIP39 (12 or 24 words) seed if it was externally injected, is a major security requirement. For protection, the Puk is required for reset.    Can I perform a Dual Card Setup with any pair of Cryptnox Wallet card ? You can only perform a Dual Card Setup with a pair or cards that was provided in the same pack. They should have a difference of one unit in the printed serial number.    Can I use an existing BIP39 seed with a Cryptnox Hardware Wallet ? Absolutely. If your seed originates from a BIP32/BIP39  wallet, you can inject it in a Cryptnox Harware Wallet card. For this, when starting the application, please choose “Other Options”, and “mnemonic”, and simply follow the instructions. You will be prompted to type in you 12 or 24 words seed.     What are the functions of Pin and Puk? The Pin and the Puk work in a similar way for accessing a phone sim card. The Pin is generally required for executing a transaction on other Cryptnox Card compatible applications. The Puk has administrative privileges, and is required for pairing your card with the biometrics of your phone, or for a reset.    Does Cryptnox have access to my wallet? Absolutely not. The wallet is  always created by the owner after receiving it, and a Cryptnox card is always required to perform transactions. It has no way to have access to your wallet.    What blockchain networks can I access using my Cryptnox card? The Cryptnox Hardware Wallet cards are compatible with bitcoin and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based blockchains. Should an EVM based network or coin not be originally listed in the Cryptnox Wallet application, it can be manually added.    How soon will I receive my card after ordering it? Delivery time can vary depending of location and sale channels. In general, it can take between one to seven days.    How is the dual card initialisation performed ? When starting the application, simply tap on “Dual Card Setup”, and follow the instructions. Both your cards will be ready to use in seconds! If necessary, you can also check our quick startup guide.    Was the card's firmware audited by an external cyber security firm? The Cybersecurity firm Cure53 was appointed to perform a security analysis of the card firmware.For more info on Cure53, go to https://cure53.de.                Linkedin

         FAQs        
What is the Cryptnox Hardware Wallet? The Cryptnox hardware wallet is a high-security solution based on smartcard technology. It supports BIP32 and BIP39 standards, making it compatible with most blockchain networks.    Do I need a Cryptnox Card to access the App? You can perfectly access the Cryptnox wallet mobile application without a card as long as a card was linked to the application previously. Without a card, you can check current balances, but a card is required to perform transactions.    Can I use DeFi and other Web3 applications using my Cryptnox Card? Absolutely. The mobile application is compatible with the WalletConnect standard which allows you to connect to most online web3 dapp. Just choose WalletConnect as a wallet option, scan the QR code with your phone app, follow the instructions on the screen, and your wallet is connected. You can then perform Defi transactions and event mint or transfer NFT.    Can I reset the card if I have lost the pin/puk credentials ? Storing your Pin and Puk together with either your backup card if you performed a Dual Card Setup, or a copy of your BIP39 (12 or 24 words) seed if it was externally injected, is a major security requirement. For protection, the Puk is required for reset.    Can I perform a Dual Card Setup with any pair of Cryptnox Wallet card ? You can only perform a Dual Card Setup with a pair or cards that was provided in the same pack. They should have a difference of one unit in the printed serial number.    Can I use an existing BIP39 seed with a Cryptnox Hardware Wallet ? Absolutely. If your seed originates from a BIP32/BIP39  wallet, you can inject it in a Cryptnox Harware Wallet card. For this, when starting the application, please choose “Other Options”, and “mnemonic”, and simply follow the instructions. You will be prompted to type in you 12 or 24 words seed.     What are the functions of Pin and Puk? The Pin and the Puk work in a similar way for accessing a phone sim card. The Pin is generally required for executing a transaction on other Cryptnox Card compatible applications. The Puk has administrative privileges, and is required for pairing your card with the biometrics of your phone, or for a reset.    Does Cryptnox have access to my wallet? Absolutely not. The wallet is  always created by the owner after receiving it, and a Cryptnox card is always required to perform transactions. It has no way to have access to your wallet.    What blockchain networks can I access using my Cryptnox card? The Cryptnox Hardware Wallet cards are compatible with bitcoin and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based blockchains. Should an EVM based network or coin not be originally listed in the Cryptnox Wallet application, it can be manually added.    How soon will I receive my card after ordering it? Delivery time can vary depending of location and sale channels. In general, it can take between one to seven days.    How is the dual card initialisation performed ? When starting the application, simply tap on “Dual Card Setup”, and follow the instructions. Both your cards will be ready to use in seconds! If necessary, you can also check our quick startup guide.    Was the card's firmware audited by an external cyber security firm? The Cybersecurity firm Cure53 was appointed to perform a security analysis of the card firmware.For more info on Cure53, go to https://cure53.de.                Linkedin

"Frequently asked questions          
What is 2FA/Multi-factor Authentication?  Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an authentication option that requires two or more unique methods of identification in order to access your Facebook account.Two-factor authentication is used to enhance the security of a Facebook account.  Facebook 2FA does this by demanding two kinds of information from the user—a password and security key.     Is a Security Key more secure than SMS verification?  Yes, security key is much regarded as the most secure authentication method online.SMS is vulnerable to today’s security challenges. For instance, where a malicious entity carries out a SIM swap, which implies totally switching a phone number to a SIM card that they can access. This lets them get the 2FA code for that mobile number.This way, they can hack people’s accounts.This is why physical security keys like Cryptnox is ideal for Facebook’s second authentication factor.    What certifications and technology does your security key have? The security key has a Level 1 certification, and the secure chip used features a Common Criteria EAL6+ certification.

This allows you to be less vulnerable to phishing, hacking and other cyber crimes.         How do I sign in with a security key on Facebook? Security keys work seamlessly with Facebook. Here’s how to easily log into your Facebook account using Cryptnox security key:Access the Facebook app and input your username and password.Once you’ve inputted your username and password, select Use security key.Authenticate your Cryptnox security key by inserting it into a card reader and connecting to your phone to activate it or hold the key near the top of your mobile device.If there is an issue with adding your security key, you will be asked to try again.Once you have added your security key, you will be signed in.

         FAQs        
What is the Cryptnox Hardware Wallet? The Cryptnox hardware wallet is a high-security solution based on smartcard technology. It supports BIP32 and BIP39 standards, making it compatible with most blockchain networks.    Do I need a Cryptnox Card to access the App? You can perfectly access the Cryptnox wallet mobile application without a card as long as a card was linked to the application previously. Without a card, you can check current balances, but a card is required to perform transactions.    Can I use DeFi and other Web3 applications using my Cryptnox Card? Absolutely. The mobile application is compatible with the WalletConnect standard which allows you to connect to most online web3 dapp. Just choose WalletConnect as a wallet option, scan the QR code with your phone app, follow the instructions on the screen, and your wallet is connected. You can then perform Defi transactions and event mint or transfer NFT.    Can I reset the card if I have lost the pin/puk credentials ? Storing your Pin and Puk together with either your backup card if you performed a Dual Card Setup, or a copy of your BIP39 (12 or 24 words) seed if it was externally injected, is a major security requirement. For protection, the Puk is required for reset.    Can I perform a Dual Card Setup with any pair of Cryptnox Wallet card ? You can only perform a Dual Card Setup with a pair or cards that was provided in the same pack. They should have a difference of one unit in the printed serial number.    Can I use an existing BIP39 seed with a Cryptnox Hardware Wallet ? Absolutely. If your seed originates from a BIP32/BIP39  wallet, you can inject it in a Cryptnox Harware Wallet card. For this, when starting the application, please choose “Other Options”, and “mnemonic”, and simply follow the instructions. You will be prompted to type in you 12 or 24 words seed.     What are the functions of Pin and Puk? The Pin and the Puk work in a similar way for accessing a phone sim card. The Pin is generally required for executing a transaction on other Cryptnox Card compatible applications. The Puk has administrative privileges, and is required for pairing your card with the biometrics of your phone, or for a reset.    Does Cryptnox have access to my wallet? Absolutely not. The wallet is  always created by the owner after receiving it, and a Cryptnox card is always required to perform transactions. It has no way to have access to your wallet.    What blockchain networks can I access using my Cryptnox card? The Cryptnox Hardware Wallet cards are compatible with bitcoin and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based blockchains. Should an EVM based network or coin not be originally listed in the Cryptnox Wallet application, it can be manually added.    How soon will I receive my card after ordering it? Delivery time can vary depending of location and sale channels. In general, it can take between one to seven days.    How is the dual card initialisation performed ? When starting the application, simply tap on “Dual Card Setup”, and follow the instructions. Both your cards will be ready to use in seconds! If necessary, you can also check our quick startup guide.    Was the card's firmware audited by an external cyber security firm? The Cybersecurity firm Cure53 was appointed to perform a security analysis of the card firmware.For more info on Cure53, go to https://cure53.de.                Linkedin
