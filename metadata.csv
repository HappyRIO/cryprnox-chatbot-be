Understanding SegWit implementation in Cryptnox Wallet            
Bitcoin continues to evolve, and one of the significant upgrades in its history is SegWit (Segregated Witness). This update improves Bitcoin’s scalability, reduces fees, and increases the flexibility of transactions. Cryptnox has integrated support for SegWit addresses in version 1.6.0, expanding the wallet’s capabilities and providing more options for users. This blog post covers SegWit, the types of SegWit addresses, and how to use them in Cryptnox.      
1. What is SegWit?Segregated Witness, or SegWit, was activated on the Bitcoin network in August 2017 as part of the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 141. SegWit separates the digital signature (or “witness” data) from the transaction data, thereby reducing the transaction size and making more space in each block. This efficiency leads to lower transaction fees and paves the way for future scalability solutions, such as the Lightning Network.Types of SegWit AddressesThere are several types of Bitcoin addresses supported with SegWit, each designed to offer distinct benefits: P2WPKH (Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash): This is the standard SegWit address format. It starts with ‘bc1’ and is typically referred to as a native SegWit address. It offers the most efficient transaction sizes and fees.  P2WSH (Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash): This format is similar to P2WPKH but supports more complex scripts. It is also a native SegWit address, beginning with ‘bc1’.  P2SH (Pay-to-Script-Hash): Though not exclusive to SegWit, P2SH is compatible with SegWit by wrapping SegWit addresses in a legacy format. It starts with ‘3’ and allows for compatibility with wallets that do not yet support native SegWit.  P2PKH (Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash): This is the legacy format (non-SegWit) address, which starts with ‘1’. It’s still widely used for compatibility reasons.Taproot (P2TR)Taproot, a newer upgrade that went live in November 2021, enhances privacy and efficiency by allowing more complex transactions while appearing as simple ones on the blockchain. Cryptnox supports sending Bitcoin to Taproot (P2TR) addresses but does not yet support receiving to them.      
2. SegWit Implementation in Cryptnox WalletWith the release of Cryptnox version 1.6.0, SegWit support was introduced to enhance flexibility and optimize transaction costs. Here’s what you need to know about Cryptnox’s SegWit implementation:Versions Supported: Cryptnox supported only legacy wallets (P2PKH) before version 1.6.0. From version 1.6.0 onwards, users can now create and manage SegWit wallets. Sending: Users can send Bitcoin to P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKH, P2WSH, and P2TR (Taproot) addresses. Receiving: Users can receive Bitcoin with P2PKH (legacy) and P2WPKH (native SegWit) addresses.This upgrade means that Cryptnox offers a wider range of compatibility, allowing users to send and receive Bitcoin using various address formats, enhancing compatibility with older and newer wallets alike.   3. How to Use SegWit Addresses in Cryptnox WalletTo start using SegWit addresses in Cryptnox, follow these simple steps: Step 1: Update to Cryptnox v1.6.0 or LaterEnsure that your Cryptnox wallet app is updated to at least version 1.6.0. This version supports SegWit wallets, while previous versions only support legacy wallets. Step 2: Sending Bitcoin Using a SegWit or Taproot AddressTo send Bitcoin using a SegWit address:Open the wallet and select the “Bitcoin”.Select “SegWit” and tap “Send”.Enter the recipient’s address (can be P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKH, P2WSH, or P2TR).Specify the amount and confirm the transaction.      Step 3: Receiving Bitcoin Using a SegWit AddressTo receive Bitcoin using your SegWit address: Open the wallet and select “Bitcoin”. Select “SegWit” and tap “Receive” to display your native SegWit address. Share the displayed address with the sender.      Benefits of Using SegWit and Taproot in CryptnoxLower Transaction Fees: SegWit reduces the transaction size, resulting in lower fees. Faster Confirmations: With more transactions fitting into each block, confirmation times can improve. Enhanced Privacy with Taproot: When sending to Taproot addresses, users gain the benefits of Taproot’s privacy enhancements. Future Compatibility: Using SegWit and Taproot addresses ensures that your wallet is ready for future Bitcoin upgrades and solutions, such as the Lightning Network.

How to Securely Transfer Cryptocurrency to Your Hardware Wallet            
Cryptocurrency can be valuable and, no doubt, act as a comfort blanket. You’re able to let it safely collect, knowing how many coins you’ve amassed, especially in tough times.However, your cryptocurrency can only be safe if you focus on two things: your choice of transfer and how you store it. While you can store your private keys on the crypto exchange for convenience, you have more control and protection over them by only storing them in your hardware wallet. Today, we will focus on the safest ways to transfer it to your hardware wallet.       
Why You Should Transfer Your Crypto to Your Hardware Wallet
 Transferring your crypto to hardware instead of a software wallet is non-negotiable, especially if you want to protect your hard-earned assets. But why SHOULD you do it? Well, transferring your assets provides the following benefits:    High Immunity
Since hardware wallets are mainly operated offline, they have higher immunity to viruses and malware compared to ones that could affect a computer or smartphone a hot wallet is active on. This means there’s no risk of malicious software accessing your private keys stored in your hardware wallet, serving as an additional layer of protection.
Long-Term Storage
The crypto exchange is not a reliable place to store your crypto because servers can collapse anytime. This means it’s risky; you could lose your crypto forever!However, hardware wallets are portable, durable devices, tamper-resistant, and withstand wear and tear, making them a trustworthy solution for crypto storage.
Backup and Recovery
If your wallet is lost, stolen, or malfunctions, you can easily retrieve your crypto due to seed phrases being used. Many of them have recovery and backup options.
Secure Transactions
With a hardware wallet, your private keys are never publicly exposed. They stay in a cold, secure environment, and stay protected from malicious threats.       
How to do?
Step 1: Generating a Receiving AddressFirst, you’ll want to enter the receiving address of your hardware wallet. You can do this by accessing your hardware wallet with your PIN. Then, on your hardware wallet, select the “Receive funds” option. Once you’ve done this, your hardware wallet will provide a receiving address for your cryptocurrency.   Note: Note: You can monitor the transaction status through the exchange or blockchain explorer.   Step 2: Open Up the Coin Exchange Next, you’ll want to input your receiving address into the exchange. While there are many coin exchanges, today, we will use Coinbase as an example. Simply:Open Coinbase on your mobile Select the send button at the top of your screen Select the supported crypto you want to transfer Next, enter the receiving address generated by your hardware wallet
Transferring from Other Exchanges
The process may be slightly different if Coinbase isn’t your preferred exchange.   KriptomatIf you have a Kriptomat account, do the following:   Log into your account Select the cryptocurrency you want to send Choose “Send” View the security notices and click the checkboxes to confirm Add in your receiving address and enter the amount you want to send Next, the total cost will be displayed alongside transaction feeds. Click preview transaction Then confirm the transaction using 2FA Press confirm – once confirmed, the funds can take up to one hour to arrive in your hardware wallet.    KrakenDo you use Kraken? Then try this:Log into your Kraken account Go to funding Select withdraw Select which type of crypto to withdraw Enter your receiving address Verify the address is correct Click confirm withdrawal    Crypto.comIf Crypto.com is your preferred exchange, then:  Open up the app Add your bank account Underneath your crypto balance, select transfer Click Withdraw from the menu Select Fiat for withdrawal Choose your preferred currency  Enter your chosen amount Select withdraw   Gemini Finally, if you use Gemini, then try doing the following:  Login  Select your chosen currency  Select the destination address, input your address Add the amount Review the transfer details Request withdrawal    Step 3: Verifying the Receiving AddressBefore confirming the transaction on any of the above exchanges, you’ll want to ensure the receiving address of your hardware wallet is correct. After all, if entered incorrectly, your hard-earned crypto is irreversible, meaning you’ll never see it again.  So always do your due diligence and verify that your hardware wallet’s address is identical on the exchange platform.   Step 4: Initiating the Transfer from Exchange/WalletOnce you’ve verified all the details, enter the specified amount you want to transfer. If it gives you the option, select preview- this will provide you with a glimpse to show the funds you are transferring are going to the right network.Review the transaction details, such as any fees, and click send now. If you’ve enabled 2FA, reconfirm the transaction by entering your second authentication method.   Step 5: Confirming the TransactionOnce you’ve confirmed the transaction, the time taken to deposit into your hardware wallet can depend on the exchange you use and the congestion of the network. You might want to regularly check your hardware wallet to see if the transaction has been made through your wallet’s interface.    Note: Note: You can monitor the transaction status through the exchange or blockchain explorer.      
Conclusion
If you want to truly maximize the security measures for your hard-earned crypto, then there’s no better option than a proprietary Cryptnox hardware wallet with dual card setup. With superior authentication measures consisting of PIN and PUK authentication and biometrics — they’re highly complex for hackers to access your private keys.Plus, with an automatically generated QR, we save you the manual headache of inputting your receiving address and reduce the risk of your precious crypto being sent from the exchange to elsewhere. So, save your time browsing different wallets, stick to what works and one that guarantees you state-of-the-art security — order our Cryptnox Dual Card Wallet today.

Understanding Passkeys and FIDO2: Revolutionizing Digital Authentication            
In today’s digital age, securing our online interactions has never been more critical. Traditional passwords, once the cornerstone of digital security, are increasingly viewed as vulnerable and inconvenient. Enter the world of Passkeys and the FIDO2 standard, which are transforming how we authenticate online interactions. This blog will explore what Passkeys and FIDO2 are, how they work, and the pros and cons of using a mobile phone Passkey versus a physical FIDO2 authenticator.      
What Are Passkeys and FIDO2?FIDO2: The Next Generation of Security The FIDO2 standard is a cutting-edge specification for authentication supported by the FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, aimed at reducing the world’s over-reliance on passwords. FIDO2 enables users to leverage common devices to easily authenticate to online services in both mobile and desktop environments. It includes two main components: the Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP), which allows external devices (such as Fido2 security keys) to communicate with a service, and the Web Authentication API (WebAuthn), which enables online services to communicate with these devices.Passkeys: A Seamless Approach Passkeys are a mobile phone dematerialized version of a Fido2 authenticator, and have similar functionalities. They apply the same standard, but are a part of the broader FIDO2 framework. Like Fido2 authenticators, Passkey credentials are never stored on a server and are unique across websites, which means they can’t be stolen in a data breach. They rely on the secure elements within modern smartphones to store and process authentication, ensuring that the cryptographic secrets are never exposed to the outside world.   How Do They Work?FIDO2 AuthenticatorsA physical FIDO2 authenticator is a hardware device such as a USB dongle or a NFC-enabled card. When you register with an online service, the service creates and sends a challenge to your device. The device then uses its private key to sign the challenge and sends it back to the service for verification. This process proves that the user possesses the correct hardware device without transmitting sensitive information.Mobile Phone PasskeysPasskeys work similarly but are integrated into your mobile device. During authentication, the user is prompted to perform an action such as entering a PIN, using a fingerprint, or facial recognition. This action unlocks the Passkey, which then signs a challenge from the service. The signature, along with the public key, is sent back to the service for verification. The crucial aspect here is that the authentication is tied to something you have (the phone) and something you are or know (biometric or PIN).      
Pros and Cons of Mobile Phone Passkeys vs. Physical FIDO2 Authenticators Pros of Mobile Phone PasskeysConvenience: Since most people carry their smartphones everywhere, Passkeys integrate seamlessly into daily life without the need for additional devices. Biometric Integration: Mobile devices often include sophisticated biometric sensors, which can be used to enhance the security of the authentication process. Eco-friendly: Using existing devices reduces the need for manufacturing and disposing of additional hardware.Cons of Mobile Phone Passkeys Device Dependence: If your phone is lost, stolen, or damaged, accessing your accounts can become complicated until you secure a replacement. Battery Life Constraints: Since Passkeys require a functioning phone, a dead battery can lock you out of your accounts.   Pros of Physical FIDO2 Authenticators No Battery Required: These devices don’t rely on battery power, ensuring they’re always ready to use. Cross-Platform Compatibility: Most physical authenticators work across a wide range of devices and platforms. Physical Security: Having a separate device can provide an extra layer of security, as it’s not tied to the multitude of tasks and potential vulnerabilities your smartphone faces.Cons of Physical FIDO2 AuthenticatorsCosts: They require purchasing a separate device. Risk of Loss: Just like keys, these devices can be easily lost, which could deny access to your services. Less Convenient: Carrying an extra device, especially if you don’t typically carry a bag or have limited pocket space, can be inconvenient.      
ConclusionBoth mobile phone Passkeys and physical FIDO2 authenticators offer robust solutions to the weaknesses inherent in traditional password-based security. The choice between a mobile Passkey and a physical authenticator largely depends on personal lifestyle, convenience preferences, and risk tolerance. As digital security continues to evolve, the adoption of technologies like FIDO2 is a significant step forward in creating a more secure and seamless online experience. Whether you choose a mobile Passkey or a physical authenticator, the move away from passwords is a leap toward a more secure digital future.

WalletConnect and Cryptnox Card: How They Work Together and Ensure Security            
IntroductionThe rapid growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology has spurred the development of innovative solutions for managing and securing digital assets. Two such solutions, WalletConnect and Cryptnox Card, have emerged as leaders in their respective areas. This blog will provide an in-depth look at how WalletConnect functions, its integration with Cryptnox Card, and the security measures that make this combination a reliable choice for cryptocurrency management.      
What is WalletConnect? WalletConnect is an open-source protocol designed to facilitate secure communication between decentralized applications (dApps) and cryptocurrency wallets. It eliminates the need for browser extensions, enhancing both user experience and security. WalletConnect is particularly beneficial for mobile wallets, enabling users to interact with dApps directly from their smartphones.   Detailed Working of WalletConnect1. Session Initialization When a user wishes to connect their wallet to a dApp, the dApp generates a unique session key and encodes it into a QR code or deep link. This QR code or deep link is displayed to the user on the dApp’s interface.2. User Connection The user opens their mobile wallet app, which must support WalletConnect (most generally do). They scan the QR code or click the deep link, initiating the connection between the wallet and the dApp.3. Session Establishment The wallet app uses the session key to establish a secure connection with the dApp. Both the wallet and the dApp exchange encryption keys to ensure secure communication.4. Encrypted Communication All subsequent interactions between the wallet and the dApp are encrypted using symmetric encryption. This ensures that transaction details and sensitive information remain confidential.5. Transaction Management The user can initiate transactions or interact with the dApp’s features from their wallet. When a transaction is initiated, the wallet app presents it to the user for approval.6. Session TerminationThe session can be terminated by either the user or the dApp at any time. This ensures that the connection is temporary and reduces the risk of prolonged exposure to potential security threats.      What is the Cryptnox Card? Cryptnox Card is a state-of-the-art hardware wallet security solution designed to store and manage private keys securely. It supports various cryptocurrencies, and provides an additional layer of protection for digital assets. The card leverages a combination of physical security and advanced cryptographic techniques to safeguard user assets.   1. Multi-Digital Assets Support  The card can store and manage multiple types of cryptocurrencies, offering flexibility to the user.2. Secure ElementCryptnox Card utilizes a tamper-resistant secure element to store private keys, protecting them from physical and software-based attacks.3. Biometric AuthenticationThe card supports biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint scanning or face recognition) via the Cryptnox Wallet mobile app, ensuring that only authorized users can approve transactions.      
What is the Cryptnox Card?Cryptnox Card is a state-of-the-art hardware wallet security solution designed to store and manage private keys securely. It supports various cryptocurrencies, and provides an additional layer of protection for digital assets. The card leverages a combination of physical security and advanced cryptographic techniques to safeguard user assets.   Integration ProcessInitial Setup The user sets up the Cryptnox Card by pairing it and initializing it with the Cryptnox Wallet mobile application (compatible with WalletConnect). Once a card is paired with a mobile phone, it relies on the authentication process of the phone (biometrics or pin) to approve transactions with the card.  During setup, the application communicates with the Cryptnox Card via NFC to store the user’s private keys securely within the card’s secure element.User ConnectionWhen the user wants to interact with a dApp, they use WalletConnect from the Cryptnox Wallet mobile application to scan the QR code or click the deep link presented by the dApp. When prompted, the user must present the Cryptnox Card at the back of the phone. This action establishes a secure session between the wallet app and the dApp.Transaction Authentication Transactions initiated on the dApp are routed through WalletConnect to the wallet app. The wallet app then communicates with the Cryptnox Card to authenticate and approve the transaction. The application displays the details of the transaction on the screen for verification.Biometric Verification The Cryptnox Card prompts the user for biometric authentication or a PIN to verify their identity. This step ensures that only the authorized user can approve and sign the transaction.Secure Signing Once authenticated, the Cryptnox Card signs the transaction using the private keys stored in its secure element. The signed transaction is then sent back to the wallet app, which completes the transaction on the blockchain.   Security AdvantagesEnd-to-End EncryptionWalletConnect ensures that all communications between the wallet and the dApp are encrypted, preventing interception and tampering by malicious actors. This encryption uses session keys exchanged during the initial connection setup.Hardware Security The Cryptnox Card’s secure element protects private keys from being exposed, even if the connected device is compromised. The secure element is designed to resist physical tampering and side-channel attacks.Biometric AuthenticationBiometric authentication adds an extra layer of security, ensuring that only the authorized user can approve transactions.This method is more secure than traditional PINs or passwords, which can be stolen or guessed.Temporary Connections Sessions initiated by WalletConnect are temporary, reducing the risk of long-term exposure to potential attacks. The ability to terminate sessions at any time enhances security by ensuring that connections are only active when necessary.Tamper Resistance The Cryptnox Card is designed to be tamper-resistant, protecting against physical attacks aimed at extracting private keys. This includes protection against various attack vectors such as voltage manipulation and electromagnetic analysis.","https://cryptnox.com/blog/walletconnect-and-cryptnox-card-security/

"ConclusionThe integration of WalletConnect and Cryptnox Card provides a powerful and secure solution for managing digital assets. WalletConnect offers a seamless and secure way to connect wallets and dApps, while the Cryptnox Card ensures that private keys remain secure through advanced hardware protection and biometric authentication. This combination strikes a balance between usability and security, making it an ideal choice for users looking to safely navigate the world of cryptocurrencies.As the landscape of digital assets continues to evolve, the importance of secure and user-friendly solutions like WalletConnect and Cryptnox Card cannot be overstated. By leveraging these technologies, users can confidently engage with decentralized finance and other blockchain-based applications, knowing that their digital assets are well-protected.

         FAQs        
What is the Cryptnox Hardware Wallet? The Cryptnox hardware wallet is a high-security solution based on smartcard technology. It supports BIP32 and BIP39 standards, making it compatible with most blockchain networks.    Do I need a Cryptnox Card to access the App? You can perfectly access the Cryptnox wallet mobile application without a card as long as a card was linked to the application previously. Without a card, you can check current balances, but a card is required to perform transactions.    Can I use DeFi and other Web3 applications using my Cryptnox Card? Absolutely. The mobile application is compatible with the WalletConnect standard which allows you to connect to most online web3 dapp. Just choose WalletConnect as a wallet option, scan the QR code with your phone app, follow the instructions on the screen, and your wallet is connected. You can then perform Defi transactions and event mint or transfer NFT.    Can I reset the card if I have lost the pin/puk credentials ? Storing your Pin and Puk together with either your backup card if you performed a Dual Card Setup, or a copy of your BIP39 (12 or 24 words) seed if it was externally injected, is a major security requirement. For protection, the Puk is required for reset.    Can I perform a Dual Card Setup with any pair of Cryptnox Wallet card ? You can only perform a Dual Card Setup with a pair or cards that was provided in the same pack. They should have a difference of one unit in the printed serial number.    Can I use an existing BIP39 seed with a Cryptnox Hardware Wallet ? Absolutely. If your seed originates from a BIP32/BIP39  wallet, you can inject it in a Cryptnox Harware Wallet card. For this, when starting the application, please choose “Other Options”, and “mnemonic”, and simply follow the instructions. You will be prompted to type in you 12 or 24 words seed.     What are the functions of Pin and Puk? The Pin and the Puk work in a similar way for accessing a phone sim card. The Pin is generally required for executing a transaction on other Cryptnox Card compatible applications. The Puk has administrative privileges, and is required for pairing your card with the biometrics of your phone, or for a reset.    Does Cryptnox have access to my wallet? Absolutely not. The wallet is  always created by the owner after receiving it, and a Cryptnox card is always required to perform transactions. It has no way to have access to your wallet.    What blockchain networks can I access using my Cryptnox card? The Cryptnox Hardware Wallet cards are compatible with bitcoin and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based blockchains. Should an EVM based network or coin not be originally listed in the Cryptnox Wallet application, it can be manually added.    How soon will I receive my card after ordering it? Delivery time can vary depending of location and sale channels. In general, it can take between one to seven days.    How is the dual card initialisation performed ? When starting the application, simply tap on “Dual Card Setup”, and follow the instructions. Both your cards will be ready to use in seconds! If necessary, you can also check our quick startup guide.    Was the card's firmware audited by an external cyber security firm? The Cybersecurity firm Cure53 was appointed to perform a security analysis of the card firmware.For more info on Cure53, go to https://cure53.de.                Linkedin

How to Securely Generate a BIP39 Seed phrase in QR Code Format, and inject it in a Cryptnox Wallet card            
In this guide, we will show you how to securely generate a random BIP39 seed phrase, generate the corresponding QR code format, and use it to initialize a Cryptnox wallet card.      
What is a QR Code? A QR code is a two-dimensional barcode that can store information such as text, numbers, or binary data. By scanning the QR code with a compatible device, such as any mobile phone with a camera, users can easily import the information without typing it manually. Therefore it also allows users to encode their private keys or recovery phrases into a QR code format. What is a BIP39 Seed phrase ?BIP 39 specifically deals with the generation of mnemonic phrases that represent cryptographic keys. Here’s a breakdown of how it works:Mnemonic Phrase: BIP 39 introduces a way to generate a human-readable mnemonic phrase from a random number. This phrase typically consists of 12, 18, or 24 words, chosen from a specific list of 2048 words.Seed Generation: The mnemonic phrase is then used to create a binary seed through a key derivation function. This seed can then be used to generate the master private key and master chain code.Security: The BIP 39 seed and mnemonic phrase serve as a backup and recovery mechanism. If a user loses their wallet or private keys, they can restore their funds by inputting the mnemonic phrase into a compatible wallet.   Important: Keep in mind that the seed phrase must NEVER be exposed to third parties, as it allows full access to your digital assets.   Step 1: Identify a Secure Air Gapped Computer? An air gapped computer is a computer that is not connected to any network, such as the internet, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi. Unless you are 100% sure that it is secure, also ensure that it has a  fresh operating system installed without any other application. Goal here is to reduce the risk of hacking, malware, or data leakage. You will also need a printer to physically print the generated QR code.   Step 2: Download the BIP39-Mnemonic Code Tool and Verify its signature Then you need to run a secure application that can generate a random BIP39 seed phrase and generate the corresponding QR code. You can use any application from the app shop, as long as you trust its source and integrity, and that it guarantees no data leakage.   Alternatively you can also get an open source application. One example of such an application is the BIP39 Tool from:https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39/releases/latest Download the “bip39-standalone.html” file, which is an html file that will be located on your computer, and can thus be executed in a browser offline. You can download the tool from the website and save it on a USB drive (or even better, burned on a CD Rom). Then, you can transfer it to your air gapped computer and run it from your browser.Before you run the tool, you should verify that it has not been tampered with or corrupted. For this, run the ha256sum command with the file bip39-standalone.html as argument in a shell terminal, in the folder where you downloaded it. Compare the output with the hash value from the download page. They should match exactly.   Step 3:Make sure your internet is DISCONNECTED when generating the QR Code   Important: Keep in mind that the seed phrase must NEVER be exposed to third parties, as it allows full access to your digital assets.   Before you generate the QR code, you should make sure that your internet connection is off on your air gapped computer. You can do this by unplugging the ethernet cable, turning off the Wi-Fi, or disabling the network adapter.      Step 4: Generate the QR Code and Print it To generate the QR code, you should follow the instructions of the QR code generator application.

     Shop now           FIDO2 Card startup guide     Step by step tutorial to Fido2 Card     Before you start: Cryptnox, a Fido Alliance member, is developing and producing a range of smart cards for various applications such as FIDO2. There is no specific FIDO2 software installation required. Compatible browsers and operating systems include built in support for FIDO2 devices (All Cryptnox software are developed for other types of cards, do not try to use them with a FIDO2 SmartCard). For the use of a Cryptnox FIDO2 SmartCard as a security key with iPhones (as of iOS 16.3), you will need a minimum of two cards. Specific instructions for iPhone can be found on the official Apple documentation here. You can purchase a Cryptnox FIDO2 SmartCard on Amazon or on the Cryptnox Shop.								     Introduction - What is FIDO2?   FIDO2 is a secure authentication protocol natively supported by most browsers, enabling passwordless and two-factor authentication (2FA) for online services. Defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (WebAuthn) and the FIDO Alliance’s CTAP, our Cryptnox FIDO2 SmartCard supports both FIDO2 and its predecessor, U2F, and is FIDO2 Level 1 Certified. This robust solution complements our broader range of secure crypto hardware wallet offerings, including guides like our Cryptnox wallet setup guide and multi-currency crypto wallet options.   Compatibility   For mobile phones in general, the Cryptnox FIDO2 SmartCard supports NFC communication with NFC enabled iPhone and Android devices. The FIDO2 NFC communication functionality is already built in, there is no software installation required. It is compatible for usage as a security key with iPhones as of IOS 16.3 for AppleID login. A minimum of two Fido2 cards is required.  Corresponding guide can be found here.For website authentication on mobile phones (via NFC), major browsers are compatible on Android. For IOS, only Safari is compatible.For website authentication on desktop/laptop (with a compatible card reader), the Cryptnox FIDO2 SmartCard is currently supported on Microsoft Windows with most browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge. On Apple MacOS, only Safari is supported on sites with a compatible implementation (compatibility is variable and must be tested on a case by case basis).For desktop/laptop login, it is only compatible Microsoft Window with a 365 Business subscription . MacOS is not yet supported. Microsoft Windows has FIDO2 communication feature built in and does not require any software installation.Compatible card reader for desktop/laptop must connect via USB. NFC reader must be ISO 14443 Compliant (13.56 Mhz).  Contact Reader must be ISO 7816 compliant.No software or driver installation is required. Compatibility is natively provided by the respective operating systems.   Windows Login with a Microsoft 365 Business Premium
   (Updated since 10th of March 2024)As listed here in the Current Partners section, Cryptnox has been registered as a Microsoft-compatible FIDO2 security key vendor. There is no need to configure Azure Active Directory anymore.Simply go to https://myprofile.microsoft.com, Security Info -> Add sign-in method. Choose Security Key and follow the instructions. You will then be able to use a Cryptnox Fido2 card to log into your Windows Microsoft account.    General Usage (Website Authentication)   The Cryptnox FIDO2 SmartCard supports two-factor authentication (2FA) and passwordless authentication:   With passwordless authentication, entering a password is replaced by logging in with the Cryptnox FIDO2 SmartCard.With two-factor authentication (2FA), the Cryptnox Fido2 SmartCard is resuired in addition to the password.   These possibilities depend of the website FIDO2 implementation. The request to authenticate with your Cryptnox Fido2 card is displayed as a pop-up notification with the “tap your security key on the reader” mention. See examples below.       With an NFC reader: simply remove and replace the Cryptnox FIDO2 SmartCard from the reader.With Contact reader: while keeping the reader connected to the desktop/laptop via USB, remove and replace the Cryptnox FIDO2 SmartCard from the reader.   Testing   For testing, you can try registering and logging into the following “test” websites: https://fido2-testing-tool.cryptnox.com  Or https://webauthn.ioMake sure your Cryptnox FIDO2 SmartCard is connected to the desktop with an NFC or contact reader.If the box “Authenticator Type” appears, choose “Cross Platform” (If you choose “Platform” it will use your computer operating system to store the credentials).Click Register and follow instructions. If asked to “tap your security key on the reader” with a contact reader, extract and reinsert the card in the reader while keeping the reader connected to the desktop.Other demo sites: Webauthn.me   Testing Sites accepting FIDO2 and U2F   Best is to check your usual websites if they already support Fido2 Security Protocol. More and more sites support such protocol every day. If they do, they generally have specific instructions. A non exhaustive list of sites accepting Fido2 and/or U2F can be found on Hideez site. In Security Protocol, choose either U2F or Fido2/Webauthn.   An example: Google Account 2FA login   Go to Manage Your Google Account and enable two steps verification following the instructions on: Enable 2-step verification for added account security Then go to Manage Your Google Account -> Security -> 2-Step verification -> Security Keys Then click on “Add security key” and follow the instructions on the screen   Managing your Crypntox Fido2 Card (Reset or Pin management)   You can manage the pin or reset your Cryptnox Fido2 Card with a Windows Desktop/laptop connected to a card reader. Go to Settings -> Accounts -> Sign In Options -> Security Key -> Manage      You can manage the pin or reset your Cryptnox Fido2 Card with a Windows Desktop/laptop connected to a card reader. Go to Settings -> Accounts -> Sign In Options -> Security Key -> Manage   AAGUID   In some rare cases, you are required to provide the AAGUID of the Cryptnox FIDO2 SmartCard: 9c835346–796b-4c27–8898-d6032f515cc5

How to Get Test Tokens for the Sepolia Network            
The Sepolia Ethereum testnet has attracted interest from the developer community due to its robust functionality and support from Ethereum’s core developers. As excitement grows, curiosity about how to obtain Sepolia testnet tokens is growing.This token is worth nothing in the real world. Still, it is essential for developers to deploy and test new smart contracts and applications in a simulated environment that mimics Ethereum’s mainnet. As developers explore Sepolia Testnet features, there may be questions about the price of Sepolia tokens. This guide shows you how to get Sepolia tokens from the faucet of the Sepolia Ethereum testnet.      
What is Sepolia?Sepolia is one of the major testnet that Ethereum core developers recommend for smart contract development. It operates on a Proof-of-Stake system similar to the main Ethereum network and serves as a practice ground for developers to test new ideas and applications. This means developers can try out new ideas and applications in a secure environment before going live on the Ethereum network. Sepolia is preferred as a reasonable testing process because it is less crowded with applications and has less storage requirements to run nodes compared to other Ethereum testnets, such as Goerli.      
Where to get Sepolia Testnet ETH tokens?Sepolia Testnet ETH can be claimed from the following faucets: • Alchemy – a well known faucet for various testnets.  • QuickNode  – a convenient multichain faucet.  • LINK test tokens (ERC20) on the Sepolia network can be obtained from ChainLink. If you have a Github account, you can get directly both test ETH and test LINK tokens. In the wallet that you plan to use, make sure that the Ethereum Sepolia network is available and/or activated. It will be a requirement to see your balances.  Each platform requires you to complete a task or meet several requirements to prevent bots and spam requests. Generally, you may need to to have a minimum of 0.001 ETH on Ethereum mainnet on the wallet address you intend to use.      
How to setup your wallet for the Sepolia testnet?To be able to see your balances, you will need to have a wallet that supports the test network you want to use. For Sepolia network, you can use any popular wallet such as Metamask, a popular browser extension that allows you to interact with Ethereum and its test networks, or the Cryptnox Walletmobile phone application. If you have the setting “Show Testnet” activated in any of these, you will have access to the Sepolia network by default.If your wallet does not support the Sepolia testnet out of the box, then you may have to add its parameters manually:   Network Name: Sepolia Test Network New RPC URL: The RPC URL can vary depending on the service provider, but a commonly used one is https://rpc.sepolia.org/ Chain ID: The Chain ID for Sepolia is 11155111  Currency Symbol: Generally, this is ETH  Block Explorer URL (optional): To view transactions on a block explorer, you can use https://sepolia.etherscan.io/These settings will enable your wallet to interact with the Sepolia testnet, allowing you to send transactions and see your balances   Get Sepolia test ETH from the QuickNode faucetQuickNode provides is a multichain testnet faucet service for various testnets such as Sepolia. QuickNode offers 0.05 Sepolia ETH daily, which can be doubled by tweeting.       Step 1   To get Sepolia ETH from QuickNode. To Access QuickNode, visit https://faucet.quicknode.com/drip      Step 2   Please select the desired connection method. Connect your wallet directly to the platform or copy and paste your address into the provided box.       Step 3   Select Ethereum from the chain option, Sepolia from the network option, and click Continue. (Enter a link to your tweet (if you write) for a double bonus, or simply skip and receive 0.05 Sepolia ETH.)   Note: To use QuickNode cocks for EVM testnets, you must have at least 0.001ETH on Ethereum Mainnet.    Get LINK test tokens (ERC20) from Chainlink Testnet Faucet Chainlink Testnet Faucet allows you to request LINK test tokens as ERC20 from the Chainlink smart contract on the Sepolia network.
For this, got to https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia If not available by default in your wallet, you may need to add manually the parameters of the LINK token on the Sepolia network:								  Make sure you are adding this new token to the Sepolia network    Token Contract Address:0x779877A7B0D9E8603169DdbD7836e478b4624789Token Name: Chainlink TokenToken Symbol: LINKDecimals: 18       Step 1   Make sure you have selected Ethereum’s Sepolia network in your wallet.      Step 2   Click Connect Wallet to allow your wallet to detect the selected network and your wallet address.      Step 3   If you want to receive funds from the testnet at a different address than the connected address, paste the address into the wallet address. Otherwise, the default for this field is the connected wallet address.      Step 4   Select Sepolia Testnet LINK (If you have a Github account, you can also get Sepolia ETH tokens directly from there)      Step 5   In case you are also requesting ETH tokens, login via GitHub “and connect a valid GitHub account to make sure you are human. This step is required to defend against spam requests.      Step 6   Click Send request. The token is sent from the faucet to the specified wallet address.    How to Check Your BalanceAfter receiving test coins from a faucet, you can check your balance using a block explorer, such as Sepolia Etherscan. You can enter your wallet address in the search box and see your balance and transaction history. You can also use your wallet to check your balance and send or receive test coins.      
How to Use Your Test Coins?You can use your test coins to test your smart contracts and applications on the Sepolia network. You can deploy your code using tools such as Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat and interact with it using your wallet or a web3 dapp. You can also use test coins to access other services and protocols that are deployed on the Sepolia network, such as Uniswap, Aave, or Chainlink.       
Example of how to use test coins to access other services. This example will be using Uniswap platform.      Step 1   Go to app.uniswap.org from your browser and select “Connect Wallet”, and then choose “WalletConnect” and select Cryptnox from the options.      Step 2   Select “Connect” from the Cryptnox Wallet app and the connection will be successful.      Step 3   Go back to your browser to perform your desired actions.       
ConclusionSepolia is a test network for Ethereum that is recommended by the core developers for testing smart contracts and applications before deploying them on the primary network. Sepolia has an uncapped supply of test ETH tokens needed to interact with the network and pay for gas fees. You can get test coins from the Sepolia network using faucets like Alchemy, Chainlink, or QuickNode. You can scan your balance and transaction history using a block explorer like Sepolia Etherscan. You can use your test coins to test your code and access other services and protocols that are deployed on the Sepolia network.

Smart Card PKI     Application of Public Key Infrastructure to
Smart Card for Blockchain Applications (Smart Card PKI)     Sebastien Armleder","https://cryptnox.com/smart-card-pki/
"
"[email protected]   www.cryptnox.com   Abstract. A smart card to be used for digital signatures is described. The smart card is factory set up with a unique identification number and digital certificate. The smart card is then associated with a user by a certification authority after successful verification of the identity of the user. Details that help in identifying the user are also transferred to the smart card by the certification authority. The smart card can then be used by the user to digitally sign documents. The smart card allows performing digital signatures with personal identification with an adjustable level of anonymity, traceability, and user-friendly private key management. It can also allow a robust, secure, and simple interaction with a blockchain.1. IntroductionDigital transactions have been on the rise over the last decade. They comprise not only traditional transactions for purchases made over e-commerce websites, but also those made with cryptocurrencies. In the context of the latter, it is noteworthy that each transaction is recorded in a blockchain and contains details of the transaction, including details that can help identify the participants of the transaction. This may be accomplished by each of the participants digitally signing the transaction using their own, unique signature. This signature can be generated using, for example, private keys held by the participants and can be verified using public keys corresponding to the private keys held by the participants. Storing private keys securely, however, can be a problem. It may be preferable not to store them in an easy-to-read or copy format. Similarly, it should be possible to easily retrieve a copy of the key or regenerate it in case it gets lost. A device that allows key management is described here. It allows user-friendly key management and provides a secure and forgery-proof method to perform digital signatures using the device. Further, it allows easy regeneration of a new private key after successful authentication of the user by a certification authority in case of theft or loss.2. SolutionThe solution we propose relates to a smart card that its setup and initialized in a particular manner to allow personal identification of the user of the smart card with adjustable level of anonymity, traceability and user-friendly key management. The solution therefore allows robust, secure, and simple interaction with a blockchain.2.1 Setup The proposed technology includes a factory setup for a smart card. The setup protocol is depicted in Fig. 1 and consists of a random number generator RNG generating a random serial number SN inside the secure element SE of the smart card. A first pair of asymmetric cryptographic keys, consisting of a private key Kpriv and a public key Kpub, is also generated inside the secure element SE.Next, the serial number SN and the public key Kpub are used to certify the authenticity of the smart card, by means of a factory certification. The generated serial number and SN public key Kpub along with a digital signing request SR are sent to a certification server. The certification server then generates and digitally signs a digital certificate CCERT that certifies the authenticity of the smart card. The digital certificate can be an X509 digital certificate signed by the root certificate of the certification server. It contains (in an encrypted form) the serial number SN and the public key Kpub from the smart card and potentially other identifying information about the smart card. This digital certificate CCERT is then sent to the smart card.      With the aid of the digital certificate CCERT and the unique random number SN generated inside the secure element SE, the smart card becomes robust against forgery. These steps complete a factory setup of the smart card.2.2 InitializationAfter the factory setup, the smart card is ready to be associated with a user. In order to enhance security, the smart card is initialized for a particular user USR using an initialization protocol. The initial steps of this initialization protocol are depicted in Fig. 2. The first step of this initialization protocol consists in the identity of the user USR being verified by a certification authority CAUTH. The user USR provides personal data UDAT such as a social security number, or another identification number, to the certification authority CAUTH for verification.Upon successful verification of the identity of user USR, the certification authority CAUTH generates a pair of keys – a public key CKpub (also referred to as certificate public key) and a private key CKpriv (also referred to as certificate private key). Any suitable asymmetric cryptographic key generation algorithm can be used to generate this pair of keys. Next, the digital certificate CCERT is obtained from the smart card. The certification authority CAUTH uses the digital certificate CCERT together with the public key CKpub and the user data UDAT to generate a digital signing request CREQ.      The digital signing request CREQ is used to generate a digital certificate UCERT establishing ownership of the smart card by the user USR as follows. After generation of the digital signing request CREQ, the certification authority CAUTH verifies the authenticity of the digital certificate CCERT obtained from the smart card. If the verification is successful, the certification authority CAUTH generates the digital certificate UCERT with the help of the public key CKpub. The digital certificate UCERT may include the user identification data UDAT, the public key CKpub, and the digital certificate CCERT. Each of these can also be encrypted appropriately for storage on the digital certificate UCERT.The final step of the initialization protocol consists in sending the digital certificate UCERT and the wrapped private key CKpriv to the smart card. CKpriv needs is wrapped (i.e., encrypted) before it is transferred to the smart card for greater security. The encryption is carried out using the public key Kpub generated by the smart card. Kpub is contained in the digital certificate CCERT and so, also in the signing request CREQ. Thus, a wrapped private key WKpriv is also generated. Finally, the wrapped private key WKpriv and the digital certificate UCERT are sent to the smart card, wherein the wrapped private key WKpriv is sent to the secure element SE of the smart card.The further processing inside the secure element SE is depicted in Fig. 3. Using the private key Kpriv corresponding to the public key Kpub already present in the secure element SE of the smart card, the wrapped private key WKpriv is unwrapped to reveal the private key CKpriv. Then, based on the private key CKpriv received from the certification authority CAUTH, a random seed SEED is generated inside the secure element SE of the smart card. The seed SEED can be generated using an SHA256 or AES encryption algorithm. This seed may be used to digitally sign transactions using the smart card.      Thus, the smart card is set up initially with its own security features (digital certificate CCERT and unique serial number SN) and only after it is successfully set up, can it be associated with a user USR. The digital certificate UCERT and the private key CKpriv further serve to ensure the authenticity of the smart card and the user. At this stage, the secure element SE of the smart card contains the private key Kpriv generated inside it, the private key CKpriv provided by the certification authority CAUTH, and the random seed SEED generated inside the smart card using the private key CKpriv provided by the certification authority CAUTH, and the smart card is ready for digital signing.2.3 Digital signingFig. 4 depicts the process of digital signature using the smart card. A signing request SREQ is sent to the smart card. The signing request SREQ is transferred to the secure element SE of the smart card where a signature SSIGN is generated based on the request SREQ and the random seed SEED generated inside the smart card. Additionally, a certificate signature CSIGN based on the certificate private key CKpriv and the signature SSIGN, and a signature","https://cryptnox.com/smart-card-pki/

Additionally, a certificate signature CSIGN based on the certificate private key CKpriv and the signature SSIGN, and a signature KSIGN based on the private key Kpriv and the signature SSIGN are generated. All three signatures, SSIGN, CSIGN, and KSIGN are then output from the smart card and serve as the digital signature from the smart card.      Because of the dependence of SSIGN on the random seed SEED, that in turn depends on a successful verification of the user USR by the certification authority CAUTH, and the dependence of the two other signatures CSIGN and KSIGN on successful authentication by the certification authority CAUTH and successful factory set up respectively, the smart card provides a robust, secure, and traceable method to enable digital signatures.3 ConclusionThe smart card presented here thus combines within a secure element of a smart card various secrets with strictly limited computation possibilities. It is centered around fundamental concepts of public key infrastructure such as X509 digital certificates and certificate authorities. Moreover, the concepts presented here can be easily extended to secure elements belonging to other devices such as NFC smart cards. The technology described here can be applied to diverse areas such as whitelisting applications, identification, seed recovery, signing of blockchain transactions, and lost or stolen card identification. Thus, it provides an easy, secure, user-friendly solution for identification that is robust to forgery or hacking.","https://cryptnox.com/smart-card-pki/

How to use a Cryptnox Fido2 SmartCard            
									Crytpnox, a Fido Alliance member, is developing and producing a range of smart cards for various applications such as FIDO2. There is no specific FIDO2 software installation required. Compatible browsers and operating systems include built in support for FIDO2 devices (All Cryptnox software are developped for other types of cards, do not try to use them with a FIDO2 Smartcard). For the use of a Cryptnox FIDO2 smartcard as a security key with Iphones (as of IOS 16.3), you will need a minimum of two cards. Specific instructions for Iphone can be found on the official Apple documentation here. You can purchase a Cryptnox FIDO2 SmartCard on Amazon or on the Cryptnox Shop.								     
Introduction — What is FIDO2 ?FIDO2 enables users to leverage common devices to easily authenticate online services in both mobile and desktop environments.The FIDO2 specifications are the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Web Authentication (WebAuthn) specification and FIDO Alliance’s corresponding Client-to-Authenticator Protocol (CTAP).More info on FIDO2 on the Fido Alliance website here.The Cryptnox Fido2 SmartCard supports the FIDO2 protocol as well as its predecessor, U2F (FIDO Universal 2nd Factor). It is Level1 Certified.   CompatibilityCryptnox Fido2 SmartCard supports NFC communication with NFC enabled iPhone and Android devices. It is compatible for usage as a security key with Iphones as of IOS 16.3. FIDO2 NFC communication functionality is already built in, there is no software installation required. For desktop/laptop, it is only compatible with Microsoft Windows for now. MacOS is not yet supported (but soon). Microsoft Windows has FIDO2 communication feature built-in and does not require any software installation. Desktop/Laptop connection requires a USB NFC reader (ISO 14443 Compliant/13.56Mhz) or a USB Contact Smartcard Reader (ISO 7816 compliant).FIDO2 is currently supported with most browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge. Apple Safari is only supported on iPhones with NFC communication enabled.   General UsageThe Cryptnox Fido2 SmartCard supports two-factor authentication (2FA) and passwordless authentication:With passwordless authentication: Entering a password is replaced by logging in with the Cryptnox Fido2 SmartCard and a PIN With two-factor authentication (2FA): Cryptnox Fido2 SmartCard is checked in addition to the password These possibilities depend of the website Fido2 implementationIf “tap your security key on the reader” is required such as any of these pop-up notifications:      With an NFC reader: simply remove and replace the Cryptnox Fido2 SmartCard from the readerUsing Contact reader: while keeping the reader connected to the desktop/laptop via USB, remove and replace the Cryptnox Fido2 SmartCard from the reader   AAGUIDIn some cases, you are required to provide the AAGUID of the Cryptnox Fido2 SmartCard is: 9c835346–796b-4c27–8898-d6032f515cc5 It might be required in some cases, such as the Windows Hello login description below..   TestingFor testing, you can try registering and logging in to the following “test” websites:https://fido2.cryptnox.tech Or https://webauthn.ioMake sure your Cryptnox Fido2 SmartCard is connected to the desktop with an NFC or contact reader. In the box “Authenticator Type” choose “Cross Platform” (If you choose “TPM” it will use your computer’s TPM chip to store the credentials). Click Register and follow the instructions. If asked to “tap your security key on the reader” with a contact reader, extract and reinsert the card in the reader while keeping the reader connected to the desktop.Other demo sites:Webauthn.me      
Sites accepting FIDO2 and U2FBest is to check your usual websites if they already support Fido2 Security Protocol. More and more sites support such protocol every day. If they do, they generally have specific instructions. A non exhaustive list of sites accepting Fido2 and/or U2F can be found on Hideez site. In Security Protocol, choose either U2F or Fido2/Webauthn.   Setting Pin and Card Reset with WindowsGo to Settings -> Accounts -> Sign In Options -> Security Key -> Manage      Follow instructions and choose to manage pin or reset card. Resetting the card will return it to factory setting and delete all credentials.      
Google Account 2FA login Go to Manage Your Google Account and enable two steps verification following the instructions on:Enable 2-step verification for added account security Then go to Manage Your Google Account -> Security -> 2-Step verification -> Security KeysThen click on “Add security key” and follow the instructions on the screen.   Windows Login with Microsoft 365 Business Premium    Note: A Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscription is required. These steps are slightly more complex than with usual Fido2 use cases, but not “that” complex either.   First you need to configure the FIDO2 security key restriction.The configuration steps are pretty straightforward and can be achieved by enabling FIDO2 Security Keys authentication method, and adjusting the KEY RESTRICTION POLICY.First go into your https://portal.azure.com/ and click on Azure Active DirectoryGot to Security -> Authentication Methods -> Policies -> Fido2 Security KeyIn Fido2 Security Key Settings -> ENABLE, select YES. Adjust the Target setting to All user or Selected Users as required.      Then go into Configure and you can either select NO for Enforce Key Restriction, such as:      Then go into Configure and you can either select NO for Enforce Key Restriction, such as:      Now that the card has been authorized in your corresponding active directory settings, you will need to register your Cryptnox Fido2 Smartcard on your account.Go to https://myaccount.microsoft.com, Security Info -> Add sign-in method.Choose Security Key and follow the instructions.Check out our guide on setting up your FIDO 2 card with the application.

How Cryptnox Hardware Wallet Cards are resistant to Nonce covert channel attacks            
A nonce covert channel attack in the context of a hardware wallet involves manipulating the cryptographic process to leak sensitive information covertly, often through the misuse of the nonce (k) in the ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) signing process. Let’s break down how this can happen and how malicious transactions might be flagged on the network:      
1. Background on ECDSA and NoncesECDSA is widely used in cryptocurrency transactions to ensure both authenticity and integrity. In this scheme:A private key (d) is used to generate a signature for a transaction. The signature relies on a randomly chosen number called the nonce (k) during the signing process. The signature (r, s) is created using the private key, the message to be signed (typically a transaction hash), and the nonce (k). For security, the nonce (k) must be random and different for each signature. If the same k value is reused for two different messages or if k can be predicted, it compromises the private key. From an attacker’s perspective, exploiting this vulnerability can lead to the recovery of the private key.   2. How a Nonce Covert Channel Attack WorksIn a nonce covert channel attack, a malicious firmware on the hardware wallet deliberately manipulates or leaks information by controlling the value of the nonce (k) in a way that allows sensitive data (such as private keys or other secrets) to be extracted over time. Here’s how it could work step-by-step:A. Malicious Firmware Fixes the Nonce (k)For a nonce covert channel attack, the firmware of the hardware wallet is compromised (malicious). Instead of generating a truly random k, the firmware fixes or deliberately modifies the k value used during ECDSA signature creation. This can be done in two ways:The attacker might fix the nonce to a known value for every signature, creating a deterministic pattern.The attacker might adjust the nonce to encode specific bits of data (for example, the private key or other sensitive information) into the signature process.B. Leaking Information via Multiple SignaturesOnce the firmware controls the nonce, it can begin leaking information through the signature process:By signing multiple transactions (e.g., small transactions that would be unnoticed), the attacker can use the known values of k and the corresponding signatures (r, s) to recover the private key (d) using mathematical techniques.In some cases, the fixed or manipulated nonce values could be interpreted as encoding a hidden message that can be later extracted by analyzing the pattern of signatures.The process of extracting the private key from manipulated nonces is often done using mathematical attacks, such as nonce reuse attacks or the Bleichenbacher attack.","https://cryptnox.com/blog/cryptnox-wallet-cards-resist-nonce-attacks/

"3. Transaction Monitoring on the BlockchainBlockchain networks, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, operate as public ledgers where all transactions, including their associated signatures, are broadcasted and recorded. This transparency allows anyone, including an attacker, to monitor the network for specific transactions containing the maliciously crafted signatures.Steps: Listening to Transactions: The attacker can set up a node or use public block explorers to passively monitor transactions being broadcasted across the blockchain network. Most blockchain transactions are sent through peer-to-peer networks before they are confirmed and added to a block, so it is relatively easy for anyone to observe incoming transactions.  Identifying the Wallet Address: The attacker will know which wallet address or addresses are under their control or have been compromised with malicious firmware. They will focus on monitoring transactions originating from these addresses.  Extracting Signature Data: Each transaction in ECDSA-based blockchains contains a digital signature, which includes the values r and s derived from the private key and the nonce (k). The attacker can extract these values from the transaction data and analyze them to detect the hidden information.   4. Detecting Malicious SignaturesThe malicious firmware in the compromised hardware wallet would encode sensitive data (such as private key fragments or other information) in the nonce (k) used during the signing process. The attacker knows the scheme used to encode the information and can extract it from the broadcasted transactions. Techniques for Detecting Malicious Signatures: Pattern Recognition: The attacker may have pre-determined how the nonce (k) or the resulting signatures (r, s) will be manipulated. For example, they might embed bits of secret data in a fixed position of k or use a predictable modification to r or s. By analyzing the transactions’ signature components, the attacker can extract this hidden data.  Multiple Transactions: Often, information leakage happens gradually across multiple transactions. The attacker monitors all transactions originating from the compromised wallet and reconstructs the leaked information by analyzing a series of signatures. They may look for patterns of small, repeated transactions, which are commonly used in covert channel attacks to spread out the information leak.Example: Let’s say the malicious firmware encodes a bit of secret data in the lower bits of the nonce (k) for each signature. The attacker would: Monitor all transactions broadcasted from the compromised wallet. Extract the signature (r, s) from each transaction. Analyze the nonce k or the signature values, looking for the expected pattern (e.g., specific bits in k that correspond to encoded secret data). Reconstruct the full secret data (such as the private key) after collecting enough signatures.   5. Blockchain Tools and Public ExplorersBlockchain networks offer a wide range of tools that make monitoring transactions straightforward. Attackers can use: Block Explorers: Public blockchain explorers (such as Etherscan for Ethereum or Blockchair for Bitcoin) allow anyone to search for transactions by address and view the detailed transaction data, including signatures.  Full Nodes: By running a full node on the network, an attacker can directly observe all incoming transactions in real-time. This is useful for monitoring unconfirmed transactions as they propagate through the network.  APIs: Some services provide APIs that allow programmatic access to transaction data. The attacker can automate the process of tracking specific addresses and extracting signatures.   6. Timing and SynchronizationSince the attacker is likely monitoring a specific compromised wallet address, they know when the wallet is making a transaction. They may even control the timing of transactions if they have direct access to the wallet or the malicious firmware. Transaction Control: In cases where the attacker has complete control over the compromised device, they may even initiate transactions themselves to control when the covert information is broadcasted.  Batching and Spacing: The attacker may space out transactions over time or batch them in a way that helps avoid detection by network monitoring tools that look for unusual activity patterns.   7. Reassembling the Leaked InformationOnce the attacker has monitored and collected enough transactions, they can start reconstructing the secret information: Analyzing the Pattern: The attacker would know the encoding scheme used by the malicious firmware. For example, if each signature leaks a few bits of the private key or nonce, the attacker collects these bits across multiple signatures and then pieces them together to recover the full private key or sensitive information.Mathematical Reconstruction: Depending on the structure of the attack, the attacker might need to use cryptographic techniques to recover the full private key from the manipulated signatures. For instance, if the nonce (k) is reused or partially known, the attacker can use techniques such as the Babai’s nearest plane algorithm or lattice reduction to derive the private key.  While the attacker monitors the network, security researchers or anomaly detection systems could also be monitoring for unusual transaction patterns. If network participants detect non-random or repeated nonces, this could lead to suspicion of a compromised wallet, potentially flagging the malicious transactions and leading to investigations.   8. What are the security protections against Nonce covert channel attacks in Cryptnox Wallet cardsThe Cryptnox hardware wallet cards are designed with two powerful security protections specifically aimed at defending against sophisticated attacks, including nonce covert channel attacks: Analyzing the Pattern: Cryptnox uses a secure element with Common Criteria EAL6+ certification, one of the highest levels of tamper resistance. This secure element makes it extremely challenging to access or manipulate the internal memory, preventing attackers from directly retrieving sensitive data or compromising nonce generation. This layer of protection guards against any attempts to physically alter the device to control or fix nonce values in signatures.Firmware Authenticity Verification: Each Cryptnox card’s firmware is digitally signed at the factory, ensuring it remains unchanged and free of malicious code. Before any transaction is executed, the Cryptnox Wallet application verifies the firmware’s authenticity by checking this digital signature. If any modification to the firmware is detected, the wallet blocks all operations, instantly preventing potential nonce manipulation. This verification protects against attempts to insert malicious firmware designed to fix or encode nonces as a covert channel for sensitive information. Together, these security layers provide robust protection against nonce covert channel attacks by ensuring the hardware and firmware remain secure and tamper-free, blocking unauthorized access and maintaining the integrity of cryptographic operations.

Crypto Aggregator            
The Emergence of DeFi and Bridge Aggregators: Simplifying Cross-Chain TransactionsThe world of cryptocurrency is evolving rapidly, with decentralized finance (DeFi) and cross-chain transactions taking center stage. As the complexity of managing multiple assets across different blockchains grows, DeFi and bridge aggregators have emerged as essential tools. These platforms streamline the process, allowing users to swap assets and bridge between blockchains with ease. This blog delves into what DeFi and Bridge aggregators are, their significance, how to connect your wallet using WalletConnect and Cryptnox Card, and how they are transforming the cryptocurrency landscape.      
What Are DeFi and Bridge Aggregators?DeFi aggregators are platforms that consolidate various decentralized finance services, such as swaps, lending, and yield farming, into a single interface. They allow users to access multiple DeFi protocols without navigating different platforms individually. Bridge aggregators, on the other hand, focus on enabling seamless asset transfers between different blockchains. These platforms aggregate data from multiple bridges to provide the most efficient and cost-effective cross-chain transactions. Some of them to mention;  • Bungee Exchange • Ondefy   Key Features of DeFi and Bridge AggregatorsCross-Chain Swaps  Bridge aggregators simplify the process of swapping assets between different blockchains. They connect various decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and liquidity pools, allowing users to find the best rates and lowest fees for their transactions.   Unified InterfaceBoth DeFi and bridge aggregators offer a unified interface that consolidates various DeFi services. This feature allows users to access multiple protocols and perform transactions without switching between different platforms.   Optimized Routes Aggregators like Bungee Exchange utilize algorithms to find the most efficient routes for cross-chain swaps. By analyzing liquidity and transaction costs, these platforms ensure that users get the best possible deals.   Security and Reliability Leading aggregators implement robust security measures to protect user funds and data. This includes smart contract audits, encryption techniques, and multi-factor authentication to ensure a secure transaction environment.   Real-Time data and Analytics Aggregators provide real-time data on asset prices, liquidity, and transaction fees. This information helps users make informed decisions and optimize their trading strategies.   Integration with DeFi Protocols  DeFi aggregators integrate with various protocols, allowing users to access lending, borrowing, staking, and yield farming services. This integration streamlines the user experience and enhances the efficiency of managing DeFi investments.      
Examples of Transactions Using DeFi and Bridge AggregatorsSwapping Ethereum for Binance Coin (BNB) Using a bridge aggregator, a user can seamlessly swap Ethereum (ETH) on the Ethereum network for Binance Coin (BNB) on the Binance Smart Chain. The aggregator finds the most efficient route, ensuring minimal fees and optimal transaction speed.   Staking Tokens Across Different Chains A user might stake their tokens in a DeFi protocol on one blockchain and then bridge the rewards to another blockchain where they can be reinvested in a different protocol, maximizing their returns across platforms.   Yield Farming with Cross-Chain Assets By utilizing a DeFi aggregator, a user can participate in yield farming across multiple chains. For example, they could provide liquidity on Uniswap (Ethereum) and then bridge the LP tokens to PancakeSwap (Binance Smart Chain) to earn additional rewards.      
The Importance of DeFi and Bridge AggregatorsEfficiency and Convenience Aggregators save users time and effort by providing a single platform to access multiple DeFi services and perform cross-chain swaps. This convenience is crucial in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency.   Cost Savings By aggregating data from multiple sources, these platforms help users find the best rates and lowest fees for their transactions. This can result in significant cost savings, especially for frequent traders.   Enhanced Decision-Making Access to real-time data and analytics empowers users to make better-informed decisions. Whether it’s optimizing a yield farming strategy or choosing the best route for a cross-chain swap, having all necessary information at one’s fingertips is invaluable.   Market Transparency Aggregators promote transparency by providing comprehensive and unbiased data. This transparency helps build trust among users and supports the overall maturation of the DeFi market.   Simplified User Experience The unified interfaces of DeFi and bridge aggregators simplify the user experience, making it easier for both novice and experienced investors to navigate the complex world of decentralized finance.      
What is Walle Connect and how it worksWalletConnect is a tool for crypto users. It acts like a bridge between your crypto wallet and decentralized applications (dApps) you want to interact with. Normally, these dApps would need to connect directly to your wallet, which might raise security concerns. WalletConnect solves this by providing a secure connection. You use your phone’s crypto wallet app and scan a QR code from the dApp. This creates an encrypted connection where the dApp can send requests to your wallet, but your private keys (the most sensitive part) never leave your phone. You can then approve or reject these requests within your trusted wallet app.   How to Connect Your Wallet Using WalletConnect and Cryptnox CardConnecting your wallet to DeFi and bridge aggregators is a straightforward process, and tools like WalletConnect and Cryptnox Card make it even easier.","https://cryptnox.com/blog/crypto-agregator/
"
"How to use WalletConnect with Cryptnox    Important: Ensure that you have installed the Cryptnox App on your device and that an initialized hardware wallet card is linked to it.      Step 1   Go to the Web3 dapp website of your choice. In this example, we will connect your Cryptnox hardware wallet card to the Bungee Exchange. Select “Connect Wallet” to start connecting your wallet.   Important: On some other Web3 Dapp websites, instead of “Login” it can display “Connect” (Uniswap) or “Connect Wallet” (Polygon Portal).      Step 2   In the list of options, select “WalletConnect” and you will see the QR code to scan from the phone.         Step 3   In the Cryptnox Wallet App, go to settings and select “WalletConnect”. Then press the “Connect” button and scan the QR code from the website.      Step 4   You will get to the screen with detailed information to link with WalletConnect. Press “Connect”.      Step 5   Scan your Cryptnox hardware wallet card to your phone when prompted.      Step 6   On the website, select “Accept and sign”.Congratulations ! Here you have successfully linked your Cryptnox hardware wallet card to the Web3 Bungee Exchange using WalletConnect and the Cryptnox Wallet mobile application.    Integrating with DeFi Ecosystems and BeyondAs the cryptocurrency landscape expands, the scope of DeFi and bridge aggregators grows. Integration with various DeFi ecosystems is becoming a critical feature. DeFi represents a significant shift in the financial world, offering decentralized lending, borrowing, and trading without traditional intermediaries. Aggregators that integrate DeFi functionalities allow users to manage their DeFi investments alongside traditional crypto assets.This integration is crucial as DeFi continues to grow in popularity and complexity. Users can benefit from having a single platform to manage both their traditional and DeFi assets, simplifying their overall investment management process. Moreover, aggregators that provide insights into DeFi projects can help users identify lucrative opportunities in this rapidly evolving space.   Security and TrustworthinessSecurity is a paramount concern in the cryptocurrency world. Aggregators, by consolidating data from various sources, inherently increase the need for robust security measures. Leading platforms employ advanced encryption techniques and offer features such as two-factor authentication to ensure user data and assets are protected.Trustworthiness also plays a significant role in the choice of an aggregator. Users need assurance that the data provided is accurate and unbiased. Reputable aggregators often have transparent methodologies for data collection and display, and they usually partner with well-known protocols and services to maintain credibility.   Future Prospects of DeFi and Bridge AggregatorsThe future of DeFi and bridge aggregators looks promising with several potential advancements on the horizon. Enhanced artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms could provide more sophisticated market analysis and predictive insights. These technologies could help users identify trends and opportunities that might not be immediately apparent through traditional analysis.  Moreover, as regulatory environments around cryptocurrencies become clearer, aggregators may offer features that help users comply with legal requirements. This could include tax reporting tools, compliance checklists, and alerts about regulatory changes that might impact investments.  The integration of blockchain technology directly into aggregator platforms could also revolutionize the way data is handled and presented. Blockchain’s transparency and immutability can ensure that the data displayed by aggregators is tamper-proof and accurate, further increasing user trust.      
ConclusionDeFi and bridge aggregators have become essential tools within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They simplify the intricate world of digital assets, providing users with the information and tools necessary to navigate the market effectively. Whether you are a casual investor or an experienced trader, leveraging the power of a reliable aggregator can significantly improve your investment strategy and overall experience in the crypto space.  By offering a centralized hub for cross-chain swaps, DeFi services, market analysis, and more, these aggregators are not merely conveniences—they are vital for anyone serious about staying informed and making

Not anymore.Welcome to the exciting world of crypto hardware wallets! With this kind of wallet, you’re not just storing wealth; you’re part of a global movement reshaping how we think about money and ownership.Every transaction you make contributes to a decentralised ledger that spans the globe, creating a network where everyone can see what’s happening, yet only you hold the keys to your own digital kingdom.So whether you’re a crypto enthusiast or a curious newcomer peeking into the future of finance, buckle up and get ready, let’s delve into the wonders of crypto hardware wallets and the benefits they bring to the table.      
What is a Crypto Hardware Wallet?A crypto hardware wallet allows users to quickly and securely access their digital assets. It is sometimes referred to as a cryptocurrency wallet or, most popularly, a blockchain wallet. Wikipedia defines it as “a device, physical medium, program or an online service which stores the public and/or private keys for cryptocurrency transactions. In addition to this basic function of storing the keys, a cryptocurrency wallet more often offers the functionality of encrypting and/or signing information.”It’s like a secure digital vault for the special keys that unlock your assets on the blockchain itself.Here’s a breakdown:Think of the crypto hardware wallet as a giant public ledger: Every cryptocurrency transaction is recorded here, creating a transparent and secure record of ownership.Your private key is like a master password: This unique code allows you to sign off on transactions, proving you own the crypto associated with a specific blockchain address.A crypto hardware wallet securely stores your private key: It also provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the blockchain, allowing you to: Send and receive cryptocurrencyView your transaction historyPotentially access DeFi features      Benefits of Using a Crypto hardware WalletUsing a crypto hardware wallet comes with a wagon of benefits, making it an attractive option for managing digital assets. Consider just a few: Unparalleled Security: Crypto hardware wallets use advanced cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and private keys. Most Crypto hardware wallets are decentralised, meaning that the funds are not held by a central authority, reducing the risk of hacking or fraud.  Enhanced Control (Be Your Own Bank): Crypto hardware wallets revolutionise how you interact with your money. You become your own bank, free from the limitations and regulations of traditional financial institutions. Transactions happen directly between users on the blockchain, fostering a sense of independence and control over your finances. Transparency and Immutability: The blockchain technology underlying Crypto hardware wallets acts as a tamper-proof public ledger. Every transaction is permanently recorded and viewable by anyone, creating an auditable and verifiable record of ownership. This fosters trust and transparency in all your crypto interactions. You can easily track your transaction history and confirm the legitimacy of any funds you receive.  Unleashing Innovation: A Gateway to the Future of Finance (Web3, DAOs, and the Metaverse): Crypto hardware wallets empower you to participate in the burgeoning world of Web3, the next iteration of the internet built on the tenets of decentralisation, transparency, and user empowerment. As the blockchain ecosystem continues to evolve, your wallet could become the key to interacting with a universe of groundbreaking applications, from decentralised lending protocols to predictive markets and beyond. It is important to note that while Crypto hardware wallets offer a wealth of benefits, they also come with the responsibility of safeguarding your private keys. Choosing a reputable wallet and implementing strong security practices are crucial for protecting your digital assets.      
How Crypto hardware wallets differ from traditional walletsImagine a traditional wallet as a safe deposit box at a bank. The bank controls access and manages your funds. Crypto hardware wallet is like a personal vault with a combination lock, only you know. Crypto hardware wallets and traditional wallets differ significantly in terms of security, control, ownership, functionality, transparency and fees.","https://cryptnox.com/blog/introduction-to-crypto-hardware-wallet/

"How Crypto hardware wallets differ from traditional walletsImagine a traditional wallet as a safe deposit box at a bank. The bank controls access and manages your funds. Crypto hardware wallet is like a personal vault with a combination lock, only you know. Crypto hardware wallets and traditional wallets differ significantly in terms of security, control, ownership, functionality, transparency and fees.      
SecurityTraditional Wallet: Banks have robust security measures, but hacks and breaches can still occur. You may be limited to recovering stolen funds. Crypto hardware Wallet: Security depends on you safeguarding your private key. Choose a reputable wallet and implement strong security practices to minimise the risk of theft. However, once compromised, recovering funds might be difficult.   Control and OwnershipTraditional Wallet: You entrust your money to a central authority like a bank. They hold your funds and control access, dictating transaction fees and limitations.Crypto hardware Wallet: You are the sole custodian of your cryptocurrency. The wallet stores your private key, giving you complete control over your funds. You can transact directly with others without relying on a bank.   FunctionalityTraditional Wallet: Designed for storing and spending physical cash or cash equivalents like debit cards. They may offer limited features such as online bill pay or rewards programs but generally focus on core transactional capabilities. Crypto hardware Wallet: Many wallets offer functionalities beyond storage: Send and receive cryptocurrency directly with others. Engage with decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, enabling you to lend, borrow, stake your crypto, and potentially earn interest in your holdings. Manage NFTs and potentially other digital assets stored on blockchain.   Understanding Blockchain TechnologyImagine a digital ledger, like a book that records every single transaction ever made. This ledger isn’t stored in one place but spread out across a network of computers all over the world. Each of these special computers (nodes) on the network verifies the transactions using complex mathematical algorithms. Every verified transaction is added to the ledger in the form of a ‘block’. Each block is linked to the previous one (called a hash), creating a chain of blocks (hence, the name “blockchain”). These blocks are secured using cryptography, a fancy way of scrambling information, making them virtually impossible to alter or tamper with.This means that the blockchain is a permanent, transparent, and secure record of every transaction that has ever occurred.   Using a Crypto hardware Wallet (Understanding Wallet Types)Choosing a Crypto hardware wallet is like picking a safe for your money. There are different types, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. By understanding the wallet types, you can pick one that fits your security needs and how you plan to use your cryptocurrency.   Custodial Wallets (like online bank accounts)Easier to use, if someone else holds your private key (like a password) for you. Less secure, and relies on a third party for safekeeping. This means you’re trusting that the company or service you use has robust security measures in place to protect your cryptocurrency. If they are hacked or experience a security breach, your funds could be at risk. Additionally, custodial wallets may limit your ability to control your own funds. For example, some custodial wallets may restrict you from sending your cryptocurrency to certain addresses or using it for certain purposes.   Non-custodial Wallets (you hold the key)More securely, you have complete control over your private key. Requires more responsibility if you lose your key, your crypto is gone.Hot Wallets (connected to the internet): These are convenient for everyday transactions because you can easily access them from your phone or computer. However, since they are always online, they are more susceptible to hacks and malware. Examples of hot wallets include mobile wallets and web wallets. Cold Wallets (offline storage): These are the most secure options for storing cryptocurrency because they are completely isolated from the internet. This makes them ideal for long-term holdings of cryptocurrency that you don’t plan on spending very often. Hardware wallets are popular cold storage options because they are relatively easy to use and provide a secure way to store your private keys. Paper wallets are another type of cold storage, but they can be risky because they are vulnerable to damage or loss. An example of a brand that offers top-notch hardware wallet security solutions is Cryptnox. Cryptnox offers solutions that use cutting-edge technology that guards against advanced threats and ensures the highest level of data integrity. With Cryptnox card, your transactions are secured by one of the most sophisticated technologies on the market.      
Finding Your Crypto hardware Wallet AddressAn important principle of Crypto hardware wallets to understand is that cryptocurrencies aren’t physically stored in your wallet; they exist as data on a Blockchain.Your wallet serves as the keeper of the keys – a public key (like your account number) and a private key (similar to a bank card’s PIN). Your wallet software uses these keys to interact with the Blockchain.When you buy cryptocurrency, you receive a wallet with an address. Please use this wallet address to receive payment. If you want to send cryptocurrency, you also need to enter the recipient’s address.How can you locate your wallet address? The method for locating your Crypto hardware wallet address depends on the type of wallet you’re using:Custodial Wallets  Look for the “Receive” or “Deposit” section within your wallet app or website. This section will typically display your wallet address in both text and QR code format.Non-custodial WalletsHot Wallets (Mobile/Web Wallets)The process will vary depending on the specific wallet you use. Generally, there will be a “Receive” or “Deposit” function within the app/website. Look for the option to “Show Address” or “Copy Address”. This will display your wallet address.Cold Wallets (Hardware/Paper Wallets)  Hardware wallets usually have a dedicated button or menu option to display the address on the device screen. Paper wallets have the address printed directly on the paper. Important Tips: Always double-check the address before sharing it to receive cryptocurrency. Never share your private key with anyone, not even the wallet provider for custodial wallets.","https://cryptnox.com/blog/introduction-to-crypto-hardware-wallet/

"Understanding different types of addressesCryptocurrency addresses, like your mailbox for digital coins, come in different formats depending on the currency and its features. Consider a few: Bitcoin addresses: These are addresses that start with a “1” or “3” and contain between 26 and 35 alphanumeric characters. They’re the most common type of crypto address. Examples: 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa or 3J98t1WpEZ73CNmQviecrnyiWrnqRhWNLy. Ethereum addresses: These addresses begin with “0x” and are slightly longer than Bitcoin addresses, usually containing 42 characters. Example: 0xde0B295669…. Litecoin addresses: These addresses are similar to Bitcoin addresses, but they start with an “L” or “M” and are longer (34-36 characters). Example: LZ1qLJLK1XuoZGbxFoeF3BQ2zRkhy9k1P5. Ripple (XRP) addresses: These start with an “r”, contain between 25 and 34 characters, and are case-sensitive. Example: rPEPPER7kfTD9w2To4CQk6UCfuHM9c6GDY.      Transacting With Your Crypto hardware WalletTransacting with a Crypto hardware wallet involves sending and receiving cryptocurrency, depositing fiat money to convert to cryptocurrency, and withdrawing cryptocurrency back to fiat. Here’s how you can do all these actions:General TipsBackup Your Wallet: Regularly back up your wallet and securely store private keys and recovery phrases. Security: Use strong passwords, enable 2FA, and consider using hardware wallets for significant amounts of cryptocurrency. Double-Check Addresses: Always double-check wallet addresses when sending or receiving funds to avoid errors. Understand Fees: Be aware of transaction fees for sending, receiving, converting, and withdrawing funds. The fees usually range from a few cents to a few dollars, depending on the size and complexity of the transaction.      
A Look at Crypto Withdrawal OptionsCrypto-to-Crypto Exchanges: These enable you to exchange one cryptocurrency for another and then withdraw to a wallet that supports the new currency. For example, you could exchange Bitcoin for Litecoin and then withdraw to a Litecoin wallet. Fiat Withdrawals: Some platforms let you withdraw funds directly from your bank account in your local currency (fiat currency). These withdrawals may take a few days to process and may incur a fee. Peer-to-Peer Exchanges: Using these platforms, you can withdraw directly to another person’s wallet in exchange for cash or other payment methods. Crypto ATMs: These are physical ATMs that allow you to withdraw cash from your crypto wallet. They’re not as common as traditional ATMs, but they’re becoming more popular in major cities.      
Security and Best PracticesYour Crypto hardware wallet holds your private keys so it is crucial to secure them from the prying eyes of sneaky bandits. Choose a strong password: Include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters to make it harder to crack. Think of your crypto wallet as your apartment. A strong password is like a deadbolt lock on your door. Use biometric technology: Most Crypto hardware wallets utilize biometric technology (such as fingerprints or facial recognition), which uses your individual traits to authenticate your identity. They are very effective since they can’t be duplicated or faked.      Why Choose Cryptnox hardware Wallet?Cryptnox hardware wallet is an innovative solution to protect your digital assets.
